dag API
=======

> The dag API comes to replace the `object API`, it support the creation and manipulation of dag-pb object, as well as other IPLD formats (i.e dag-cbor, ethereum-block, git, etc)

#### `dag.workbench`

> Creates a virtual workspace where you can create nodes and delete them, without paying the cost of constantly hashing

##### `Go` **WIP**

##### `JavaScript` - ipfs.dag.workbench(??)

If no `callback` is passed, a [promise][] is returned.
