# Bootstrap API

> Manipulates the `bootstrap list`, which contains
  the addresses of the bootstrap nodes. These are the trusted peers from
  which to learn about other peers in the network.

> Only edit this list if you understand the risks of adding or removing nodes from this list.

* [bootstrap.list](#bootstraplist)

#### `bootstrap.add`

> Add a peer address to the bootstrap list

##### Go **WIP**

##### JavaScript - `ipfs.bootstrap.add(addr, [options], [callback])`

- `addr` is a [multiaddr](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiaddr) to a peer node
- `options.default` if true, add the default peers to the list
- `callback` must follow `function (err, res) {}` signature, where `err` is an error if the operation was not successful. `res.Peers` is an array of added addresses.

#### `bootstrap.list`

> List all peer addresses in the bootstrap list

##### Go **WIP**

##### JavaScript - `ipfs.bootstrap.list([callback])``

- `callback` must follow `function (err, res) {}` signature, where `err` is an error if the operation was not successful. `res.Peers` is an array of addresses.


#### `bootstrap.rm`

> Remove a peer address from the bootstrap list

##### Go **WIP**

##### JavaScript - `ipfs.bootstrap.rm(peer, [options], [callback])`

- `addr` is a [multiaddr](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiaddr) to a peer node
- `options.all` if true, remove all peers from the list
- `callback` must follow `function (err, res) {}` signature, where `err` is an error if the operation was not successful. `res.Peers` is an array of removed addresses.
